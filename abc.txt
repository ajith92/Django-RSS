Title : A one-man army behind Errorception – the front-end whiz, Rakesh Pai

Rakesh Pai
Twitter has become one of the biggest sources for journalists, and so was the case again when I came across a tweet from Wishberg about Rakesh Pai’s startup. I checked up what the man does and it certainly was something that would pique interest – he runs a company called Errorception. The name gives an intriguing first impression, and further investigation necessitated a profile on this man who has the likes of Khan Academy, SoundCloud, Zendesk, Cleartrip and Guardian as his clients.
Rakesh Pai builds robots and is also a beer guzzler, but primarily he is a front-end developer. He has been in the space for a decade. He tells me that in the beginning, he was just a developer but his vision widened over the years and he was then able to develop something that got widespread adoption. Here is how Rakesh narrated his story to me:
You see, front-end programming is sometimes characterised as being rather painful. There’s a good reason for it. Front-end programming – if you aren’t aware – is the bit where the programmer’s code doesn’t run on well controlled and safe-guarded servers managed by massive teams, but out in the wild on people’s browsers. The thing about browsers is that they aren’t all created equal, don’t run on similar platforms, and are nearly infinitely customisable by their users. As a front-end developer, you have to care about this. This is what people see, and what defines the perceived quality of any product. And if a site is broken, it’s only human to think that the products they are selling are sub-standard too.
Every good front-end developer is conscious of this. However, the 3D-matrix of browsers, browser versions and operating systems that every front-end developer has to cater to is just crazy. There’s just no way it’s humanly possible to make sure that your site works everywhere. This is the plight of every single website on the Internet, including that of the very biggest giants. Every site has bugs. If users come across these bugs, they usually simply move on. The programmers never find out. How would programmers fix stuff if they aren’t even aware of it?
I didn’t have such a holistic view for this, back when I was working as a developer. I was just another front-end guy, trying to build sites. As a responsible front-end person, you care about what your users perceive. And just like everyone else, I had absolutely no way of knowing what they perceived!
Because server environments are so controlled and organised, it’s relatively easy to know what’s happening there. I always envied the tools server programmers had. They seemed to always have a finger on the pulse of what’s going on. I wasn’t even close to that sense of control. It was the nature of the technology, and I was envious.
I stumbled upon the idea of capturing errors from the browser, and somehow recording it so that it could be reviewed later. You see, browsers throw errors very frequently. Much more frequently thank you think at first. And all these errors are simply lost, because they happen on your computer, not on the fancy server clouds that website operators control and monitor all the time. So, what usually happens is that some front-end developer writes some code that they hope will work. They might even have tested it reasonably well. However, it might not work in many common setups, and they have no way of knowing. There is usually a lot of prayer involved. This isn’t how software should be written today!
So, that idea was brewing in my head. Meanwhile, I quit my job – this was about 2.5 years ago – and decided to start up with a bunch of friends. This is after having worked on front-ends for about 8 years. A couple of months in, and we realised it isn’t going to work. Better early than late, right? Savings eaten into, no income in hand, depleting bank balance – I had to do something quick.
After we decided to go our own ways, I launched Errorception in 15 days flat. It was obviously crap at launch, but it was out there in front of people’s eyes, and I started getting solid users and solid feedback. I was overwhelmed by how well it was received. In all honesty, it still surprises me. I modified – even rewrote everything – to handle the incoming upsurge of traffic. Do you know what it’s like to rewrite a live service? It’s like changing the wheels of a car. While it’s running. At 200 kmph!
Errorception is still a single-person company. I’m just a front-end programmer who taught myself the skills to make it possible to assist people who were sailing in the same boat as me. I’m fortunate that the problem has been a common one – one that all people from companies big and small have faced. Errorception is run by just me, my servers and my code-scripts that make sure everything is working like clockwork. Errorception is built on the most cutting-edge of technologies, making it possible to make the most efficient use of all available resources.
There’s another aspect to Errorception- front-end programming, however important it is, has so far been majorly carried out by amateurs. One of the reasons for this is that it’s a rather new field of engineering. Another is that it is cross-discipline, overlapping with design, usability and UX.  Errorception has managed to find itself in right that space – where smart people want the best tools to ensure that they can deliver the richest experience for their users. Put differently, Errorception delivers quality tooling that front-end developers should demand and should expect.
Based out of Mumbai, Rakesh has certainly achieved something phenomenal and one can expect many more names to be added to the list of clients Errorception has.

Title : Strategy stories for businesses – ‘The Reality Test’ by Robert Rowland Smith
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/strategy-stories-for-businesses-the-reality-test-by-robert-rowland-smith/
Date : Tue, 08 Oct 2013 00:30:13 +0000

Who are you? What’s your organisation for? Are you sure you’re adding any value? Would you buy what you sell? Do you even know what the market is? How much dead wood should you carry? Are your decisions a science or an art?
These are some of the 48 questions that are the titles of chapters in ‘The Reality Test’ by Robert Rowland Smith, a book urging business leaders to go beyond the typical strategy questions such as, ‘What is our revenue target?’ or ‘What is our market proposition?’ Macroeconomic factors aside, the real reason businesses fail is that they run out of energy, or they don’t believe in their product, or their leaders are too vain to heed advice, or they treat their customers like idiots, or they are sabotaged from within, the author notes. Such are the realities, he adds, that ‘strategy’ is too rational to account for.
The book opens with the story of business identity, narrated from the author’s experience as a rookie consultant at a high-street drugstore, which ‘featured everything from underwater cameras to umbrellas, sunglasses to sandwiches,’ even as custom was dwindling. Then, there is the tale of Japan’s Kongo Gumi, a temple construction company that existed ‘from the jaw-dropping early date of 578 until 2006,’ for 1,428 years; why the company died is something you would read in the book.
How do you connect with customers? A common answer is, ‘Through customer service.’ Instead, why not stand in the customers’ shoes, the author asks. He talks about a workshop he ran for about twenty senior managers from a retail bank, who were part of a project to drive up customer service. When the question came up, about what it would be like to stand in the customers’ shoes, the senior managers readily acknowledged that their customers were much less well off than they were, and struggling with debt, the author recounts.
Shifting the discussion from a rational level to a more emotional one, the workshop required the participants to imagine what it would actually feel like to be paid much less than they were, to be struggling with debt. Before long, the language changed from a purely analytical to a more emotional one, the author writes. “They began talking about being in debt as ‘trying to keep your head above water,’ ‘feeling like you’re drowning in debt,’ ‘being in it up to my eyes,’ ‘being in over my head.’ Debt, it seemed, was like being in water and out of control.”
Taking the discussion out of the workshop room, the senior managers were required to live on the average salary of their customers for a week, so that they could feel what it was like. More interestingly, as the book chronicles, the managers were taken to a swimming pool and made to experience their own metaphors. They were made to tread water in the deep end until they started to get the sense of not quite being in control, of being inundated with ‘debt.’
This, the author observes, made the managers move from thinking about their customers to feeling what it was like to be them. What happened, thereafter, you may wonder. The managers went back to redesign the customer service program from the ground up, with far greater emphasis on real customer experience, the author concludes.
A book worth missing your flight for.

Title : House repair services now has a new name, Travtus Work Force
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/travtus-house-repair-services/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 22:30:50 +0000
content : 
What do Theek Kar Do, Jack on Block, My Home Maker and EasyFix have in common? It’s their area of business, viz household maintenance and repairs. When we last chatted with Theek Kar Do, Hardik Shah, the co-founder said they have been making steady progress in their plans and he is also aware of Travtus Work Force – a new entrant in household maintenance space.
Travtus WF offers electrical, plumbing, carpentry, patch work, window work and tile work options to its customers. Like My Home Maker, Travtus also works on an annual maintenance contract (AMC) model and has two options to give its customers – quarterly plan for Rs 2,525 and an annual plan for Rs 1,894.

Customers have to call 022 65554747 to book a repair and based on the convenience of the customer the repair is scheduled. Currently Travtus WF is present in Mumbai and has plans to enter Bangalore and Singapore soon.
Tripty Arya
One thing that separates Travtus WF from the other names in the list is the backing of Travtus – the parent company of the same name which is in the business of construction. Travtus WF is being headed by Tripty Arya who is the founder director at Travtus WF. A qualified architect, Tripty worked in a PE firm for a while, before joining their family business of construction. Talking about her trigger to branch out on her own, Tripty says: When I was in the construction business, I would get a lot of calls from friends and family to send electrician and plumber to their homes. And when I noticed it happens more often than you expect, I realized there is a demand for a service that can accumulate such service,” she says.
Travtus WF currently has 20 technicians working for them part-time and a few of them on a full-time basis. Tripty says through Travtus WF her attempt is to position their services as something which consumers see as an investment for their house and not just a service.  “We want customers to look at this as something that they have brought for the house. We go with the hashtag #Houseproud, you are going to put it as an investment in your house and whenever you need  it, you know it’s on call,” says Tripty.
While the labour charges are covered in the AMC amount, cost of material is on top of that. Travtus WF does not repair appliances but has tied up with Jeeves, incase any customer of theirs calls up with such a request. And for housekeeping work they have tied up with Hammer & Mop. Since starting in June this year, Travtus WF has 35 customers on board, which includes one spa, two offices and few restaurants. Unlike residences, commercial customers are charged either on per month or per year rate. Progress has been slow but steady: “In the last two months we have hit all the targets we intended to, it’s not as fast as we would like it to be, but we think it’s a model that will slowly catch on,” says Tripty optimistically.
Most business acquisition for Travtus WF so far has been through word of mouth and referrals. The Travtus WF team currently comprises five people who are all on the operational side of things. The team of technicians that Travtus WF works with also works in the construction businesses of Travtus, which Tripty says is an advantage, as all of them are trained in the area of work because of their association with the construction business.
Travtus is on its way to launch their Singapore operations later this year. In that market, Travtus WF is looking to hire technicians from the vocational training institutes in that country. And would mostly interact with facility managers at residential buildings to get access to end customers. Tripty is bullish about the opportunity that exists in the space. “We have a huge competitive advantage, because we have a trained professional workforce, who are are already well-equipped with what has to be done. The only major competition we still have is the unorganized market, where customers would call the electrician around the corner, who charges Rs 200 per trip, but customers are not able to come out of that psyche. You are trying to change the way customers will look at this area, not as services but as something you would buy for the house,” says Tripty.

Title : Love, Books and Startup – Story of RangRage

Neeti and Gagan Jain
While looking at the admission list at Times School of Management notice board, Gagan Jain was a bit shy and had butterflies in his stomach as he saw the name of a jain girl also in the same batch. Little did he know that this is going to be a ride for his life.
They were classmates, used to work on the same project as a part of a team. When they passed out they were not on talking terms with each other. While Neeti comes from a well-to-do family, where freedom and learning were greatly emphasised upon, Gagan had a diagonally opposite past. He had to leave home to work as his father was on the verge of bankruptcy and he had to join English classes to learn English (It seems Gagan has improved a lot as he co-authored his first book;-)).
Denim which led to birth of RangRage
As they passed out and went their own way, destiny had other plans for them. Both of them were placed with Times of India but at different locations, soon they changed jobs and Gagan started working for Landmark Retail in Dubai, while Neeti joined Lowe Lintas & Partners in Jaipur.
Few years later, Gagan returned to India, and with him cupid also returned this time, and helped them come closer to each other via Google talk. Soon the frequency of their chats also increased. Meanwhile their parents also started looking for suitable partners for marriage, thus they sensed a great opportunity and engineered their own love cum arranged marriage.
Story of a Denim, RangRage and The Start Up Diaries
In August 2011, they were planning to write a book. But just like any other idea, there were more critics than supporters, people started telling them to improve their English, start from a blog etc…So they put the idea on hold.
In Oct 2011, Gagan had to visit Paris for a fashion conference and to make sure that he doesn’t lose on the fashion quotient, Neeti hand-painted a denim for him. Gagan says the denim was a head turner and everybody stopped doing what they were doing and looked at Gagan appreciatively when he visited Eiffel tower wearing that jeans. Gagan immediately called Neeti and shared the joy. Thus the idea of RangRage was born. They did a pilot using few hand-painted t-shirts and saw returns up to 10x. As a result they built RangRage, an eCommerce platform which sells hand-painted merchandise thus promoting local painters and talented young artists to reach their commercial potential.
RangRage Merchandise
While building RangRage, Gagan also spoke to one of his friends about the book who said,
“Likhne ki iccha hai, likh do. Nahi chapegi koi baat nahi.”
and it inspired both of them to start working on the book again. They wrote to around 50 entrepreneurs, heard back from 8 of them and finally featured 6 entrepreneurs (Read the book to find out who were they). It took them around 2 years to finish the book and get it published.
Couples starting up is not something which we are witnessing recently and has been an old phenomenon.
We wish them a great future.

Title : Shailendra Singh spells out secrets of enduring success
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/shailendra-singh-spells-out-secrets-of-enduring-success/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 15:30:48 +0000

It was an otherwise normal day at Bangalore. But, at ITC Gardenia, the fourth edition of TechSparks lent the city an electrifying atmosphere. The annual blockbuster of YourStory went up several notches, in the words of the attendees, “right from the packaging of sessions to the quality of conversations was spectacular.” One talk that stayed with everyone, at the end of the day, was the keynote address by Shailendra Singh, MD of Sequoia Capital.
If last year’s keynote of Shailendra Singh was like a blitzkrieg from Sachin Tendulkar at his peak, peppered with glorious sixes, this year’s was like Rahul Dravid playing elegant strokes to build a splendid innings. He said that, in a fast pace of change, enduring success is a challenge. Quoting the example of JustDial which took 17 years for an IPO, he added that it takes 10 to 15 years to build a successful business. Enduring success is built around four themes, according to Shailendra, which are moat, agility, culture, and perseverance.
A moat is a defensible system that manifests as superior technology, network effects, consumer brands, user experience, ecosystem and operating model. Taking the example of Sequoia portfolio company, Pine Labs, which facilitates 10% of all credit card transactions in India, he said network effects began to manifest only after 15 years. Lokvir Kapoor, who joined the company in 2004 as a co-founder, launched a cloud-based payment platform in 2010 and helped it see 5x growth in three years. The effort is also a result of perseverance. It’s a moat because of the kind of the operating model that has been built to bring benefits to all players (retailers, banks, and card-processing companies) in the ecosystem.
Agility is the ability to learn quickly and adapt to change. Jaspreet Singh, at 26, took over as CEO of Druva, a backup and disaster management solutions company, though he was not initially taken for that role. The initial product, Replicator, was a failure. Quickly changing tack, Druva developed InSync, a laptop backup and disaster recovery software, which proved to be a huge success. Another product, Phoenix, was also a failure. Emphasising that a company should quickly move on to newer products, he said Druva is an example of an agile company. Now, the failed products, Replicator and Phoenix, are sought after by customers. It was ranked by Gartner as No. 1 in the category of data governance protection in 2012. Druva has seen 25x growth, since its launch in 2008.
A company that exemplifies culture as a hallmark of its success is Mu Sigma, a decision science company, helping organisations make decisions based on big data analytics. Dhiraj Rajaram, cofounder and CEO, has brought in unique cultural elements that blend together to help the company succeed in unique ways. It has surpassed $100 million in revenues. Employees are encouraged to raise questions to the extent that there is an award for the best question every month. In a lighter vein, Shailendra explained how Dhiraj appeared in a lungi, a casual attire, after a pooja at home during a customer visit. This shows openness and authenticity to the customer, he added.
The example of grit and perseverance is SCIO Health Analytics led by Siva Namasivayam. The company, which is into health care space in the United States, missed every single target in the initial two years after its founding in 2007. A couple of its acquisitions failed. Layoffs and cost cuts ensued. But in January 2011, an acquisition turned successful, and the company steadily climbed the ladder of success to record Rs 300 crore revenue in 2013. Shailendra said the success was possible because Siva dug in and kept trying without giving up.
In sum, the lessons for all the entrepreneurs out there are – Endure, persevere, and success will be yours. Don’t be afraid to fail; fail and iterate. It just gets better with time.
Shailendra went on to engage in a fireside chat with Ambiga Dhiraj, Head of Fulfillment, Mu Sigma (which, in his own words, is not a portfolio company but a partner). Ambiga wowed the audience with her openness about the culture Mu Sigma has built over the years. She explained how Mu Sigma focused on “learning over knowing” and betted on innovation play to solve problems. “You need to have a leaky bucket to learn in an agile manner, it is only by unlearning that you can learn more,” she added. She explained how Dhiraj quit his existing job and won RFP from a global company, which was his first customer, despite attending a lunch meeting with a swollen mouth due to wisdom-tooth removal. She narrated how customers are asked to interact with analysts on the floor instead of being engaged with presentations in the conference rooms. Ambiga also modified the term work-life balance to work-life integration. She felt that there shouldn’t be boundaries between work and life. She also explained how the employees are encouraged to question anything happening around the company to make it better.
Questions from the audience included why Mu Sigma has a fixed salary structure for a new employee for three years (which is increased year after year), instead of announcing increments every year. She explained the uniqueness of Indian culture and the challenges young people face when thrown into a corporate environment right out of college. Despite fixed salary, every two weeks, the new employees are given a performance report, to enable them to improve. Her talk left the entrepreneurial audience with a lot to mull over.
It was inspiring to see Shailendra give centre-stage to Ambiga, and the conversation that ensued was an open testimony to how an investor and investee can have a strong bond.
Shailendra added an icing to his keynote by announcing a Series A investment in Idea Device, a TechSparks 2011 alumnus.
Let’s all try and pick “endurance” as our mantra as we go about building our own ventures.

Title : Building a company from scratch- Takeaways from a TechSparks panel discussion
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/building-a-company-from-scratch-takeaways-from-a-techsparks-panel-discussion/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 09:35:29 +0000
content : 
In the second of the panel discussions at TechSparks 2013, Alpesh B. Patel, dealmaker at UK Trade and Investment and founding principal at Praefinium Partners, Sanjay Anandaram, venture partner, SeedFund, Saumil Majumdar, co-founder and MD, EduSports, Srikanth Iyer, CEO, TutorVista and Pearson Education Services, Saju Pillai, co-founder, idea Device and Shashank ND, co-founder, Practo discussed the intricacies of ‘Building a Company from Scratch’.
The session was moderated by Pankaj Mishra, national editor, at business newspaper, Mint.
Majumdar: One of the first things is to identify the big problem to be solved and even if you are reasonable successful in doing it, you can achieve big success just because the pain-point itself is humongous.
Shashank: Ensure that you are doing two things: 1) Get the product management right; and then 2) positioning the product to sell – pitch to customers and not to media.
Majumdar: The market and customers are willing to work with you if you are willing to quit your job and focus on the startup full-time.
Patel: Should you quit your job? If your dream is not big enough you won’t quit. Scale idea till it’s big enough to quit, you will know, because you can’t bear not to start off the next morning.
Pillai: Don’t build in a cave or in your office, go out and meet customers even if you have a few slides to show, they need to know what you are making, and most of them are open to talking.
Anandaram: Sometimes you have a superstar, and you have other employees, and sometimes you have a more equitable structure.
Superstars are not aware of weaknesses. Self-awareness is important, founders find that they are maxed out, even when they hire somebody to do the job they do backseat driving. You have to remember that what is good for the company is good for me but what is good for me is not necessarily good for company.
With founders there’s ego and emotion. The important milestone is to be self-aware.
Patel: Well you have heard of the 3 D’s- do, delegate and delete, you should add delegate, delete or die. Don’t do everything yourself.
We need more dumb entrepreneurs, if you look at some of the earlier founders like Bill Gates, he did not finish school they let other people do it. Find out who is the best person to do it.
Iyer: We built an education company and proved that there is a market. After reaching scale we had opportunity to merge with Tutorvista and asked whether they should merge or go off on their own. We hired the right people and did not do backseat driving.
Anandaram: Raising money should not be an end in itself. Lot of people who have taken money from unsavory sources have lived to regret it. Make sure that you take from it from the right sources.
Iyer: My advice would be to delay taking money for long period of time, It could be one of the smartest things to do. If you really need it there is no lack of resources.
Iyer: We had to let go of 75 people but explained to them why they were being let go by conveying the message with sincerity. This is extremely important. That was 11 years ago, still half-a-dozen of the 25 are still there.
Iyer: You should consider your parents as one of the first stakeholders and convince them about your idea.
Anandaram: Most companies are started with friends, but they may not be right people for the job. You need people for business development, marketing and other needs.
Pillai: Business is done on merits, it’s a no-brainer about offering bribes. These questions have been asked earlier, when the market gets to know that we don’t accept bribes, they stop approaching us.
Patel: The ease of doing business is better in the UK than in India, Indian companies need to have their base in India, but could also source from other countries like the UK.
Anandaram: In 1987, I was asked to sell computers in Bihar, I told my boss that I might be asked a bribe. He asked me what per cent of customers will ask for bribes, when I replied 90 per cent, he asked me to get business from the remaining 10 per cent.

Title : 2 months of intense training underway at TiE-IQ bootcamp, Mumbai
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/tie-bootcamp-mumbai-2-months-training/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 07:00:40 +0000
content : 
Last week, when we dropped into at one of the TiE – IQ bootcamp sessions, it could have been mistaken for a classroom of students amidst an academic group discussion. Armed with pen and paper, the 40-50 odd people in the room, were discussing customer segments for their products. The subject of discussion was similar to what would be discussed in a B-school – identifying your customer – but the difference here was that this group was not doing this exercise to earn their certificates. But they were seriously looking at customer segments, because they are entrepreneurs – strategizing on real businesses, real products and looking at real customer and markets.
The TiE – IQ bootcamp that kicked off earlier last month is a 60 day session, which has been divided into four fortnights to track the progress of participants. From the 35 applications received from Mumbai & Pune, 10 were shortlisted to undergo the 2-month long camp in Mumbai. Talking about the event, Kanchan Kumar, ED, TiE Mumbai tells us, “The entire idea of the bootcamp is to help startups get enough mentoring and hand holding in the 2 months. Within the said time, we want to help make businesses viable, startups should go out with a ready product and be ready to goto market.”

The theme for this bootcamp is B2B technology and all the final 10 were startups in that space. Only those were admitted who had at least a minimum viable product(MVP) ready. The four fortnights at the camp has been divided as follows. First one was about finding a product solution fit. “Many startups build a product first and then think about the market that the product can cater to. But we focus on that aspect first — getting the right problem solution fit for your product. We also help them plot the competition, do target segmentation – all this is done with a grid of sorts, where we sit with the businesses and do the plotting for them in these different areas,” explains Kanchan.
In the second fortnight, startups have to actually go to market and do customer validation of their business and record their experiences. Through the 60 days, regular meetings with mentors and experts are done for startups to help them improve their ventures. In the third fortnight startups are helped fine tune their pitches, work on their elevator pitch, writing introductory mails and mock pitches are done. Startups are helped to make a single page introduction of their product that can be used by them for showcasing their products to customers/investors externally. The last fortnight is all about growth hacking, where bootcamp participants get to meet startups who have scaled their businesses, and learn from them in person, the life skills required to survive in the outside world.
We spoke to the participants at the bootcamp and all of them were unanimous on the effectiveness of the format. “I think the time taken for us to develop the product, understand customers, market, how to sell, etc is cut short because of the training we get here,” said a participant. “None of us feel confused now, the sessions and learnings have been very helpful. The best part is that mentors are also entrepreneurs and not some big shots in corporates. This helps us understand, how they built their own businesses,” said another participant.
The bootcamp is currently in its third fortnight, and will have their demo day in Bangalore in early November.
The TiE-IQ bootcamp is sponsored by Nexus Venture Partners & India Quotient. YourStory is their media partner.
Following are the participants of this bootcamp:
1. Effte – Effte provides tools to automate trading strategies in a simple, secure and inexpensive way
2. Treashare Online – Treashare helps event organisers increase engagement with online and offline audience and archive event data.
3. Convrz (Thalia Technologies Pvt Ltd) – Convrz is a messaging platform for modern teams. It enables Twitter like #tags and smart keywords right in the messaging thread to optimize work flow and improve productivity. It allows teams to merge multiple tools – chat, project management, task management, notes etc – into one, thereby simplifying work life and saving time.
4. BugClipper – BugClipper makes it very easy to report bugs directly from the apps and saves 70% of the bug reporting time.
5. MeraBackup – MeraBackup is like a bank locker for your Tally data. It automatically backs up your tally data, quietly in the background.
6. Sharemojo – Sharemojo reduces cost of customer acquisition for online merchants by enabling them to create their very own performance-driven referral program.
7. Sapling Design – Sematools makes consumer perception surveys easy and affordable through web-based visual survey solutions.
8. MyEffecto – MyEffecto is a feedback plugin for websites and bloggers. It helps users provide clearer, one-click feedback and publishers to get analytics of reader responses and post consumption behavior.

Title : What is the innovation secret of Apple, Google and Zappos? Gerard Tellis tells us…
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/gerard-tellis-innovation-techsparks/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 06:25:00 +0000
content : 
Gerard Tellis, professor of marketing, Neely Chair of American Enterprise, and director of the Center for Global Innovation at the Marshall School of Business, the University of Southern California, Los Angeles was the guest of honor at TechSparks 2013.

Tellis a well-known expert on innovation, advertising, and global markets, spoke about his new book ‘Unrelenting Innovation’. Tellis’ previous book ‘Will and Vision: How Latecomers Grow to Dominate Markets’ is a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller. Philip Kotler, one of the world’s best known management and marketing gurus and S.C. Johnson & Son Professor of International Marketing, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University says this about Tellis’ latest book: “I would rate Unrelenting Innovation as one of the best business books I have read. All CEOs need to read it to avoid the incumbent’s curse. Unrelenting Innovation offers brilliant insights into the need for innovation and managing the risks of innovation.” The book is based on a study of 770 companies across 15 countries, the origin of 90 radical innovations spanning over 100 years, and the evolution of 66 markets spanning over a 100 years.
Tellis’ talk centred around answering the questions why wildly successful companies fail, why culture is at the heart of fostering innovation and how can companies inject innovation into their DNA.
Tellis started with how almost all the most successful companies in the world fail because they don’t nurture a culture of unrelenting innovation. He gave the examples of Sony and Kodak, which were once super-successful, but were felled by smaller companies because they did not have the right culture. Kodak was not only the leader in photography but also held the most number of patents for digital photography, yet the advent of digital cameras, that included mobile phones, drove the company to bankruptcy. Speaking about Sony he said, “Before the iPod was released, Sony was three times the size of Apple, but after three years Apple became double the size of Sony.” The reason? Apple had out innovated Sony, even though the Japanese company had invented the world’s first portable music player – the Walkman.
Tellis stresses that companies need to adopt three best practices. “The three things they need to incorporate into their culture are – embracing risk, focusing on future, and cannibalizing successful products,” said Tellis. He gave an example of how Gillette creates a successful product, then kills it off at its peak by introducing other more innovative products. Big companies have a tougher time innovating because of an ingrained culture that doesn’t spur innovation, a built-in bloat of bureaucracy, and is generally slow to react. While changing culture is difficult, Tellis says that its not impossible, “Yes, its tough but look at how IBM changed their culture through Louis Gerstner.”
Tellis has spoke about three corporate practices that can help companies foster innovation inside their organizations.
1) Incentives for enterprises
Many companies, he said, incentivise experienced people who have seniority and age. This only fosters loyalty but not innovation.
Failure in most countries is considered a shame. This is counterproductive and what is needed instead is strong rewards for success and weak penalties for failure. In Germany, it is difficult to startup after you have declared bankruptcy, and in Japan, if you go bankrupt it is almost impossible to start again. That’s different in the US, in Silicon Valley for example, bankruptcy is a badge of honor.
He quoted former IBM executive Tom Watson, who said, “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.”2) Increasing internal competition
This can be done through idea fairs, funding contests, prototype races and competing commercialisation. In this atmosphere, employees generate ideas, peers judge the and managers facilitate their execution.3) Empowering innovation champions:
Every employer is an innovator when bottom-up innovation is encouraged. Innovation has come from deep in the bowels of an organisation. The danger of not recognizing, motivating and rewarding top innovators is that they will leave in frustration.

Title : Pokkt’s journey to becoming an alternate mobile payment platform and GSF’s Singapore push
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/pokkt-mobile-payment-gsf-singapore/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 04:45:03 +0000
content : 
Rohit Sharma, Pokkt
Pokkt is a Mumbai-based startup founded over a year ago by a formidable team. Rohit Sharma, a veteran in the digital space who previously was the CEO of Digital Business, Reliance ADA group, is at the helm of the company, with co-founders Vaibhav Odekar and Sharad Ingule. Vaibhav is an IIM Lukhnow alumnus with experience in banking and digital industry while Sharad has more than a decade of experience in product engineering in web and mobile. The company was a part of the GSF batch last year, where it was selected as one of the top four companies to raise additional external rounds.
The pivot that led to the current version of Pokkt
Pokkt initially started with a B2C focus, where it was a platform for users to come on and get exclusive coupons from various online partners. The deals were exclusive because the user had to perform certain actions (download an app, fill up a survey, etc.) before he or she could get the coupon. They launched the site but soon realized within a few months that the going would get tough. Pivoting quickly, they shifted focus to focus on businesses as their customers.
The current avatar of Pokkt is that of an alternate mobile payment platform that helps owners of Paid Digital Goods and Services to monetise their users through an advertiser-funded model. Pokkt helps developers and publishers to convert non-paying users to paying users for any kind of monetisation be it pay per download, try and buy, virtual goods transactions, subscription etc. While for advertisers, Pokkt gives multiple engagement tools.
For users, the method is lucrative as it allows them to buy digital goods by alternate methods like watching videos, subscribing to services, installing applications, participation in surveys, etc. Pokkt has been operational from three months and has managed to get more than 25,000 people to use the platform.
Funding journey and GSF’s Singapore push
Rajesh Sawhney
Pokkt has raised the initial seed round from Rajesh Sawhney founded GSF and then went on to receive the next funding round in February 2013 from Jungle Ventures and Samir Bangara (which is being announced today). An experienced team with a knowledge of the space made it easier to raise funds for Pokkt. The team strength is 11 members at present and the company moved base to Singapore when they were in discussions with Jungle Ventures.
Talking about GSF’s Singapore push, Rajesh Sawhney says, “I’ve always encouraged companies to have a global approach. Any startup building a product needs to think worldwide from day one for scale.” GSF has developed extensive network in international markets to help startups expand into various regions quickly.
Rajesh was an early investor in Viki which got a $200 million exit to Rakuten and this is also probably one of the biggest exits for an Indian angel. A Singapore based company, Viki had a large vision from the outset and went on the become the Hulu for the rest of the world (Hulu is a US based company). “Increasingly, you’ll see more and more GSF companies have a base in various countries to scale internationally,” says Rajesh.
Surely a sign of a maturing ecosystem, we’ve now reached a stage where more and more Indian product companies will achieve international status.

Title : Close the loop as you close the funding round
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/funding-investor-founder-view/
Date : Mon, 07 Oct 2013 03:08:17 +0000
content : 
*I am restricting the scope of this piece to an active funding round wherein there is interest from both sides and in-depth interactions have happened, rather than routine first meetings and preliminary interactions. For the record, closure is equally important in both cases.
The last couple of months have been particularly enjoyable for me as a venture investor. With several new deals and follow-on rounds in the works during this period, I have had the opportunity to observe some fantastic founders and co-investors in action. And interestingly, a specific characteristic has stood out that makes them awesome – consciously and elegantly ‘closing the loop’ once the term sheet has been signed.
There is enough written about how VCs don’t respond adequately and drop conversation threads abruptly, in context of deals they are rejecting. However, the importance of positive closure is actually two-sided – it applies both to -
(a) entrepreneurs, who need to close the thread with investors that actively pursued them, spent considerable time evaluating their venture but ultimately ended up not doing the deal for a variety of reasons; and
(b) investors, who need to give honest feedback and help out founders that gave them the opportunity to evaluate their funding round and allocated significant bandwidth to help with diligence efforts.
1.      The founder’s view
In any funding round, though a founding team might interact with tens of investors, typically there would be 1-2 firms (in addition to the eventual investor) that would have been genuinely interested in the opportunity. They would also have devoted fair amount of effort to diligence, and in the process, the respective deal teams would have established a personal rapport with the founders. In several cases, these deal teams would have either been unable to convince their Investment Committees on the opportunity, or would have lost out to the eventual investor on deal terms.
Even after the round has been successfully closed, these firms would continue to be of strategic importance to the venture for several reasons:
To take advantage of these benefits, it’s important that post signing of term sheet, the founding team picks up the phone and personally closes the loop with top 2-3 firms that engaged with them the most. Though there is no obligation, it’s always good to hear from founders why they chose one investor over the other (could be valuation or other deal terms, sector focus, pace of closure etc.). Even if there is a banker running the deal, the CEO closing the loop personally is an extremely positive reflection of the founding team.
2.      The investor’s view
To be honest, investors are guiltier of dropping the ball on this front as compared to founders. VCs are essentially in a ‘services’ business, with founders as their clients. As with any business, even though things might not have worked out this time around, the same client can again buy from you at a later stage. This client will also talk about you among peers, giving you either a positive or negative word-of-mouth. The same client could also be a potential customer, supplier or business partner for your other clients. Investors can ill-afford to ignore these dynamics.
The key, again, is to actively communicate, irrespective of the deal outcome. In case the investor is rejecting the deal after putting significant effort on it, it’s always helpful to genuinely share key concern areas directly with the founders over a call. This will help them preempt and address these issues with other potential investors that might be in advanced stages of diligence.
Even if founders have signed the term sheet with another investor, it’s important that the investor continues demonstrating commitment towards building the relationship and exploring areas where both sides can help each other. For instance, venture firms can provide valuable customer introductions while founders can be valuable sources of quality deal flow and domain knowledge/ expertise for the firm.
It’s amazing how something as simple as picking up the phone and closing a conversation thread gets overlooked so often by both founders and investors. Deals are momentary but relationships are built for life – internalizing and implementing this thought is what differentiates outstanding entrepreneurs and VC firms.

Title : Early career marketplace for students and young grads – collegefeed
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/land-a-job-at-tesla-or-nasa-with-collegefeed/
Date : Sun, 06 Oct 2013 01:31:08 +0000
content : 
I think it’s quite strange when I find college grads on LinkedIn. A whole section of your profile has to be left incomplete, unless you add your experience at summer jobs. And the more you think about it, LinkedIn as a platform is not meant for college grads. Arguably, the most appealing thing about anyone’s LinkedIn profile is the professional experience section and the testimonials, which most students won’t have.
To tackle this problem, Google’s former product chief, Sanjeev Agrawal, created collegefeed, which acts like a personal career assistant to help students and new grads find their dream jobs. The platform aims to modernize the job-search process by leveraging the latest technology – social media, big data, real-time communications, etc. They claim that many students, universities and employers have already joined in the U.S.
Collegefeed.com
The USP of collegefeed is a recommendation engine that maps your skills and companies that you’d like to work for, which you enter as a first user. Post this, collegefeed shows you jobs which would suit you in the companies that you’d work for. It also shows you similar jobs in other companies as well. Based on the entered data, collegefeed also shows you similar companies, to the ones that you’ve chosen.
Students from premier institutes, who are aware of the companies in the West, have found great use for the platform. collegefeed shared some testimonials with us, from students from BITS Pilani and IIT M -
“Collegefeed offers an incredible opportunity to ambitious international students to showcase their skills alongside some of the best in the world,” said Anjishnu Kumar, BITS Pilani. “The sheer potential of this platform gives me goosebumps. I can’t wait to see what happens as it grows. This is an idea whose time has come.”
“Thanks to Collegefeed, I can now connect with international students with quality startups and small companies – platforms that we would otherwise never come in contact with,” said Siddharth Gupta, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. “Coming into contact with such companies at an early stages of their life can really be a catalyst to starting your career.”

The company had earlier been in Beta and had tested it with the students of Berkeley University, Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University. In this time, the company also went on to raise a round of funding from various investors, including 1.8 million USD from Accel Partners. They have now opened the application to the rest of the world, along with a networking tool.
Founder Sanjeev Agrawal believes that the networking essential  says, “With summer over, the newest crop of grads is out there right now trying to find a job. Nearly 50% will fail. Sure, networking is the #1 way to get hired – and LinkedIn is great once you already have professional experience – but where do college kids even start? We at collegefeed have introduced a new tool, that lets users quickly build a network of peers in their field from around the world, from Birmingham to Bangalore to Boston.”
Jobs listing
Another interesting thing collegefeed is doing is called Idea Swag. Sanjeev says, “We envision a world with greater interaction between companies and college students. That’s where Idea Swag comes in. Companies can offset tuition expenses with cash prizes or let users compete for the hottest new gadgets like an iPhone 5c, X-mini UNO speakers or Jawbone via Collegefeed’s employer-sponsored awards.”
The questions are open-ended and thought-provoking. The company claims that the applicants don’t have to be a rocket scientist to enter and all they need are fun, original ideas. Through Idea Swag, employers get the opportunity to assess, identify and recruit the right talent before they graduate. And students get significantly better exposure to companies early. The first Idea Swag sponsored is by eBay.
The company makes its money through the jobs listings, but as a result, what we see with collegefeed is a great proposition for the Indian student who’s looking to work with all those aspirational companies, which are seemingly impossible to get into. At the same time, it exposes some very interesting companies to the students whom they would have otherwise have never heard of. The companies have a great proposition by getting in touch with a completely new set of students, who are just as adept as the candidate they hire through their existing channel.
It will be interesting to see how this spans out in India in the coming days.

Title : Creating global products with borderless innovations
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/creating-global-products-with-borderless-innovations/
Date : Sat, 05 Oct 2013 13:40:47 +0000
content : 
In the day’s first panel discussion at TechSparks 2013, panelists- Kavin Bharti Mittal, head of strategy, new product development, Bharti SoftBank, Nick Talbot, Global Design Head, Tata Elxsi, Pallav Nadhani, Co-Founder and CEO, FusionCharts, Rejenish Umapathy, WebEx Business Lead – India and SAARC, Cisco, Srikanth Karnakota, Country Head Server and Cloud Business, Microsoft India and Gautam Mago, Principal with Sequoia Capital India spoke about ‘Global Products with Borderless Innovations’.
The session was moderated by Ravi Gururaj, Chairman & Co-Founder, Frictionless Ventures.

Here are the broad areas that were discussed.
Mago: There is no choice but to go global. What excites us is the size of the opportunity, for example, the legacy enterprise software product market is $500 billion in size. Most of it is on old code bases, the replacement opportunity for this software is a huge opportunity. If the Indian companies do not do this, somebody in the global market will do it.Mittal: The product has to be nothing short of phenomenal. Like in messaging we acquired many users as the user experience was very good. If you launch an app for the first time and its not good you lose users.Talbot: Strong impression that I get from SMBs, is that they think that we have big potential in India and why should I bother to think global when we have a captive market. You can launch in India first, but bench-mark globally.
Mago: The playbook keeps changing on how to build a business. Depends on the stage you are at, if you are serving enterprise, developer or ISV market you have to global from Day 1.
But the consumer and SMB market is different, India is a petri dish, but even then you should think global because competitors in Prague and Kenya and so on are doing the same thing.Nadhani: We did not have an option to sell in India, we had to start selling globally from the get-go. Being global is better than being local. Some customers said that if we knew you were an Indian company, we could not have bought your product. Delivering from 0-1 million is fine, but 1-100 million is challenging, what’s needed is a playbook.Karnakota: Different point of view on how startups should think of global- doesnt start with vision with whether it will be global or indian- most startups are looking at prob and looking at solving it- going global happens later- bucketing innovations- set of companies doing better and cheaper innovation- solution gaps not solved by others- third- difficult- unstated needs. start with the problem and design- and then think of going global.
Startups need to be clear about which target segment you want to address and design for that market. In terms of product expansion, you need to be ready with next set of product features.
Mago: Start small, because hiring the people who will do it is difficult, but this will improve over the next 5 years.Nadhani: Core thing are being built by Indians outside- we need indian diaspora to build something here. To build a global product, you need a higher threshold in terms of access to talent and info systems.Talbot: I have been here for two years and I see some improvement, and some universities are picking up and producing good talent. Parents want all their children to be engineers and doctors and not go and become ‘hippies’.
Nadhani: We have difficulty in building global products because there is a cultural problem. Our education is spoon-fed, most graduates want to join a company. I have interviewed 1000s of potential employees, only 10 odd have built something thats is open source. Even when you join a company, the services mentality is pervasive.
If you look at social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) we are more adopters and users, but we are not building it. There’s a glimmer of hope, some core technologies are being built by Indians outside and we need those Indian diaspora to build something here.Mittal: Culture is a big factor and we are 10 years behind the US. Here we have a lot of people building the same thing. Take China, they have had Alibaba and Tencent even in India there are some startups who will shift the market. The trick is how to reach 100 million people at low-cost.
Indian universities do not produce enough good talent who can become product managers and so on. Unlike Stanford, where a iPhone 101 course, where students were taught to build apps, was launched as soon the iPhone debuted.
Nadhani: Its not just language features changing but the emotions attached to it. Don’t enter a geography with a lot of unknowns. We don’t have playbooks for Russia or Japan, all experimentation will have to be done by you. Find clusters like the US and Canada, succeed there and then think of other markets. In India customers want ‘do it for you’ (DIFY), even for SaaS products, unlike developed countries where they will ‘do it yourself’ (DIY).Mittal: What you launch in India is not applicable for rest of the world. When you look at China, Korea and so on their markets are extremely insular. India, because we are english speaking we can target beyond the top 100-200 million, but beyond that the market changes. Now you need understanding the life of users in Tier 2-3 cities, they use ‘Hike’ differently in tier 3 cities. We never thought of launching ‘Hike’ in Germany, but they did picked it up. The idea is not to be too complex for bottom and not too trivial for the top. 30 per cent of our user base is global.
Think big, but start small.
Mittal: Mobile payments is huge, just look at M-Pesa in Kenya, in India regulation is an issue, but its moving in the right direction.Talbot: Resource and resource management is a huge opportunity, like micro-grids- how to manage energy, same with water and food, there is a resource crunch. Technology will help make it better.Mago: Using new data sources to tackle problems for large enterprises like data from devices and sensors could help spawn big businesses.Rejenish: Crowdsourcing: how we govern ourselves will move to a crowdsourced model. How to find the movers and shakers within your company in a space that you are interested in.Nadhani: Healthcare and gamification to make India healthier and become health conscious is a huge opportunity. Big data from social media on how to tackle corruption is another example.Karnakota: The opportunity is to reimagine what’s happening with enterprise software, we could do a lot with just understanding how employees consume apps.

Title : Madan Padaki on ‘Building a global Venture Out Of India’
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/in-a-fireside-chat-building-a-global-venture-out-of-india/
Date : Sat, 05 Oct 2013 11:10:21 +0000
content : 
At TechSparks 2013, Madan Padaki spoke about ‘Building a global Venture Out Of India’. Padaki, co-founded skills assessment company, MeritTrac Services and sold it to Manipal Education. Currently he is co-founder and chairman at rural social enterprise Head Held High Services (HHH). Padaki spoke about his startup journey and how ventures could build a global company out of India.
It all started in 2000, when he attended TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs) conference, and he got this mad idea (his words) of starting a company that was into skills assessment. Padaki and his co-founder were not very familiar with with human resources but decided to startup anyway. “We were thrown out all the VC firms that we went to but that did not deter us,” said Padaki.
They finally found an agriculturist who pumped in Rs 1 crore, but he lost as the money he invested. “Post 9/11, we were 15 days from shutdown, then we slowly started to do well in 2003, but by 2004, we were almost running out of cash. That’s when Helion rescued us with some equity infusion and we also raised money from HSBC. And in 2005 we sold the company to Manipal Education,” adds Padaki.
While MeritTrac did well in India, it did not do well globally. “Unlike MeritTrac, Manipal Education gets 50 per cent of revenues come from outside India,” points out Padaki. The problem is simple. MeritTrac never looked at designing the product to go global but did not have the architecture to go global. So after building the Indian business they were ready to scale globally, but when we were unable to do so, because it was too late to change the product mid-way.
Padaki advised that at the very outset, the business model, has to be global- and noy just when they are ready to pursue an opportunity.
With his latest startup, Padaki has made sure that the HHH platform can be deployed globally. He spoke a bit about one of HHH’s initiatives. “We took Ramesh, a zero educated villager, his entire family earned Rs 3000 per month. He was put through a gruelling 16 hour for 7 months, where he was taught english, math and soft skills like confidence. We turned him into somebody who even his mother could not recognize,” remarked Padaki. Ramesh now works in a village BPO run by HHH and earns Rs 15,000 a month now. Padaki refers to individuals like Ramesh as Rubans or rural urbans (more a mindset) and the efforts to boost livelihoods in villages as Rubanomics (Ruban + economics).
HHH now plans on deploying the same model globally across geographies like Brazil, Colombia and Africa. They are already in talks with representatives in Brazil and Colombia and working on customizing the model for them.
The other ways to globalize and understand how going global can help is through global startup programs. He pointed out to the immense experience and learning, which Guruji- a teaching and gamification platform- garnered after being selected for the Unreasonable at Sea program power of what is possible. Padaki also pointed out to Silicon Valley incubator programs like 500 startups.
Padaki also thought of a clever way to get global representation for his company by choosing angel investor across the world. One of their angels Kartik, has opened doors with the government in Colombia. “We don’t have a sales team in Colombia but we have an angel investor, who’s doing the sales for us,” iterates Padaki.
HHH is also striving to make the concept of Rubanomics as a subject for study in business schools and has already created a Centre of Rubanomics at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research in Mumbai and are also in talks to sign on with a school in Brazil.
Summing up, Padaki said that the technology platform has to be global, scalable ( they are building a ruban app store) right from the early stages of development. The globalization model needs to fit into the overall strategy for the company. He ended with saying that every enterprise needs to be global otherwise its self-limiting.

Title : Positive signs for Re-Commerce, YNew looking to expand
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/ynew-re-commerce/
Date : Sat, 05 Oct 2013 08:46:11 +0000
content : 
When you want to sell your old mobile phone or that plasma TV, you may look to online classifieds sites like olx, Quikr etc. Though online classifieds has solved this problem to a large extent, some pains are still to be solved. The problems with these sites are many including but not limited to -
1) Physical travel to deliver/pick up your product, thus waste of precious time.
2) Once you buy a product, its your responsibility even if it stops working within one hour of getting delivered.
3) If the product is big (like a plasma TV) then only god can help you if the item gets damages during transit.
4) You never get to know whether the product you are buying is actually working or a quick-fix has been applied to it.
Who are they
We introduced YNew earlier this year, who brings a fresh perspective on this issue while solving the core issues at hand. YNew calls themselves as a Re-Commerce platform (Repair/Recycle old products and sell them).
The best part of YNew is that each product is tested using over 13 different parameters by the engineers at YNew before it is put for sale, Thus making sure that you donât get a shabby product. And also since they offer door pick up and delivery so there is no chance of product getting damaged during transit.
Expansion Plans
After launching a pilot store in Hyderabad to check the offline model and feasibility, Dashradh Ram Nutakki (Ynew Co-Founder) is looking forward to open 9 more franchise stores by December 2013, which includes 5 stores in Bangalore and 4 stores in Hyderabad.
During Phase 1 of the expansion YNew stores will be spread across all five geographical zones of Hyderabad and more stores will be added depending on the market demand.
YNew Pilot Store
YNew has further plans to expand to 50 franchise stores by 2016. While Ram is very positive about the future, success of Re â Commerce is and how well it will catch with Indian market is something which only time will tell.
We wish YNew a great future ahead.

“We’re here to make machines more useful by making them a bit more human: fun, intelligent and relevant. They will sense as babies, observe and play as youngsters, learn and change with you as they grow older.” Thus reads the vision of Mad Street Den.
The company’s co-founder and CEO, Anand Chandrasekaran, says that his
AI (artificial intelligence) startup delivers intelligence as a cloud-based stack for customers to incorporate in their applications, rather than their having to develop the algorithms they need. There are very few consumer applications that use AI, and Mad Street Den aims to make intelligence available to the world, he adds.
Three experiences
Mad Street Den promises to deliver three categories of experiences, viz. fun & play, usefulness & convenience, and helpful & revealing. “Someday in the near future, we hope to bring everyday objects to life, not just the devices we use today,” the site notes.
Anand
In Stanford University, as Post Doctoral Scholar, Anand was member of the team that built Neurogrid, a Neuromorphic system that simulates a million neurons in real-time. He also designed and simulated an axon router chip, capable of demonstrating structural plasticity in addition to synaptic plasticity.
Prior to co-founding his own startup, Anand worked as Research Scientist in Evolved Machines, Inc., developing neural algorithms capable of solving real-world sensory classification problems; and as consultant in Zort Technologies, serving the broad software development needs of clients with a particular emphasis on technical computing in the realms of pattern recognition and machine learning.

You can meet Anand at TechSparks on October 5, 2013.

Title : Close to million downloads with Zitrr and a big partnership; the story of Rootwork’s early success
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/rootwork-zitrr-photography/
Date : Fri, 04 Oct 2013 07:15:06 +0000
content : 
IITs and NITs are premier engineering colleges in India. A breeding ground for a lot of technology startups nowadays, one can expect to hear a lot more from them. One such story is brewing up at NIT Allahabad where six youngsters from various parts of India found a synergy together and started up Rootwork. They did give corporate life a chance but soon realised that their heart lay somewhere else.
Team Rootwork
A good mix of technology enthusiasts and photography lovers, they were fiddling with the ideas combining these two domains and landed on a rough idea for an app early in 2012 while still in college. They worked on various technologies but recognised mobile software as their space and started out by building apps on Android, iOS and Windows 8. “We also have a product studio (Zitrr) through which we publish our own app ideas, and market them under our banners (Rootwork and Zitrr), says Piyush Rawat, one of the six co-founders: Pratik Bhadkoliya, Ratnesh Neema,Nirmal Prasad, Mohit Nigam, Bharat Chudasama. Rootwork is currently a team of 15 based out of Bangalore and Baroda.
Success with Zitrr
Zitrr Camera is a photo editing app on the which got them huge success first up. “We decided to go with iOS as we knew the channel had a higher chance of monetization. We experimented with keeping it paid and making it free intermittently but once we were featured on some of the popular app platforms, we saw a flurry of downloads,” says Piyush. Zitrr Camera has crossed 800,000 downloads and will go beyond a million very soon at the current rate. Almost 65% of these downloads have been paid. The other apps in their portfolio include Slypy and BhakSala.
The Big Deal
Samsung Electronics Korea is building consumer apps on their platform Tizen and had invited a few select companies to develop these apps for them. Rootworks is probably the only Indian startup to have been selected and they are building two versions of Zitrr for Samsung. Rootworks will be getting $65,000 for the partnership and more projects down the line. This and other projects have enabled this young startup to setup their offices in Bangalore and Baroda.
“Most ITes companies would have a typical ‘give-and-take’ business model in the b2b space. We curated different models of engagement where we also work like associates with companies on consortium agreement, while entering into an association as a mobile technology partner with them,” says Piyush. They have around 4-5 collaboration going at the moment, with companies unrelated to mobile space.With the wind behind their back, the team is very positive about the prospects.
Talking about the drive and vision, Piyush says,
“When we started we had nothing in mind except the drive that we want to build a brand in mobile software space. A brand that people, and we ourselves, would like to work with. Like many other entrepreneurs, we’re not married to any of our ideas. We take pleasure in executing others’ ideas. We started bland, but over time, we got married to entrepreneur’s lifestyle. We like to see how our establishment is growing everyday, and the contentment we get everyday is already worth a million dollars. Everything else is on top of that.”
One of the promising new companies in the mobile software area, Rootwork has had a jump start on which they can propel themselves to push forward.

Title : Amit Tandon’s journey with Ventana to convert waste plastic into useful fuels
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/amit-tandons-ventana-waste-plastic-fuels/
Date : Fri, 04 Oct 2013 02:40:12 +0000
content : 
Amit Tandon is founder and CEO of  Ventana  – a company which has developed technology for conversion of waste plastics to petroleum fuels similar to diesel and gasoline.  A greentech entrepreneur and a passionate engineer,  Amit has authored five patents in this field and leads a team which today is at the forefront of solving one of the most thorny challenges within waste recycling – the challenge of recycling waste plastics.
Globally, almost two-thirds of waste plastics are land-filled or littered every year.  In the last few years alone, littered plastic choked underground sewers which resulted in floods in Dhaka, Mumbai, Manila and elsewhere.  So, when Amit first came across the possibility of recycling waste plastics to generate useful fuels in 2006, the solution greatly intrigued him. “I was awed by the fact that the concept offered twin benefits – of diverting landfill bound wastes and generating renewable fuels from it. Here was an opportunity for a win-win, to do good while doing good,” he says.
Amit spent the next several years researching and studying the underlying depolymerization technology that enables the conversion process. “I love to deconstruct large engineering problems to smaller bits,” he says “and I can be tenacious – very tenacious at doing this”.  Most research work in the field at that time limited itself to arcane laboratory models and wherever larger conversion systems had been attempted, they lacked financial economics and had to be eventually shutdown. “Such systems deployed intensive batch based processes to generate lower economic value synthetic crude, slurries and petroleum waxes. The numbers just doesn’t work out on such systems, howsoever you do the maths” Amit says.
The field also suffered from “a high noise to signal ratio” – with many protagonists and scientists claiming shovel ready, zero emission technologies with secret proprietary chemical catalysts as their main ingredients . “It took me several years to chase down such hogwash claims and see them for what they were,” says Amit. However, the work during this time also helped him understand the significant complexity of developing and scaling a usable technology in this domain, as also the business model shifts that were needed to ensure risk mitigation across various stakeholders – from feedstock suppliers to fuel offtakers.
In 2009, after a few years of intensive research in this domain, Amit faced a binary choice – to exit what was largely a promising but underdeveloped sector or to do the opposite – dive in deep to develop and deliver a cost-effective, fully continuous depolymerization technology which would take waste plastic and directly convert it to petroleum distillates. “It was a tough call – the risks were largely incalculable at that time – it wasn’t like we had a clear line of sight from where we were to where we wanted to be. We were chartering unknown waters and with technology development such as this you can only see so far before you hit a corner.”  However, there were also some key favourables going for him, which he cites:
Working with a few expert engineers borrowed from the parent company, Ventana designed its first generation pilot for conversion of waste plastics to fuels in 2009 and commissioned the same in 2010. It has since, commissioned two more pilots at its R&D centre near Chandigarh and in late 2012, commissioned a 3rd generation plant which implemented a fully continuous process for direct conversion of waste plastics to distillates similar to diesel and gasoline. The plant has run successfully for several months and Ventana has filed for multiple international patents on their IP. The company has also obtained determination from a US-based environmental firm that the technology meets stringent USEPA emission norms and produces 4 -8 X energy in calorific terms (in resultant fuel) than what it consumes in the form of electrical energy from the grid.
Ventana Pilot Plant
Amit says that this wouldn’t have been possible without his teammates, including Siddharth Mohan, Ashish Singhal , Rakesh Dutta and Biresh Thakur – who bring deep experience  with chemical, mechanical, electrical and process engineering and come from leading engineering institutes such as IIT  and Wayne State (USA). “Many of my current teammates left greener prospects in Fortune 500 companies to work on this – for me they’re the real behind-the-scene stars here,” he says.
Asked as to what motivates them, Amit says – “Most regions of the world have a 70-95% rate of recycling for waste paper, cardboard and metals. However, plastic recycling almost everyplace is at a much lesser rate. With plastic to oil technology, we believe this sector is poised for a disruptive change – and Ventana has a real chance to play a leading role in making this happen. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of that?”
Ventana’s development partners include Mott MacDonald (design engineering), Environmental Strategy (Philadelphia, permit engineering) and Indigo Energy (Atlanta, fuel offtake) and is on the starting line to commercialize the technology and give it scale.

Title : 60,000 retail outlets, over 10 million customers served in 6 years. Creating ‘Suvidhaa’ for Indians
Link : http://yourstory.in/2013/10/suvidhaa-paresh-rajde-haresh-bhatija/
Date : Fri, 04 Oct 2013 02:30:24 +0000
content : 
redBus and Flipkart are names from the Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem that are well-known globally. What is common to these two ventures is that they became successes solving problems, which are very specific to India. So if redbus makes bus ticketing easy, Flipkart made product shopping easy for Indians across the country. Both these companies have been written about and everyone knows much about them. If I personally think there is another company which has the potential to grow as big as these two names, then its Suvidhaa. You may not have have used their services, because we are among the privileged segment of Indian society with broadband connections and who can transact online. But there is a much larger segment of customers in India, who continue to be baffled by technology.
However, you may still want to use Suvidhaa to pay your insurance premium or book railway tickets, next time you go shopping to your neighbourhood kirana. Suvidhaa, which means convenience in Hindi, is a startup that helps you pay your utility bills, book your rail & air tickets, pay your premiums and do many other such transactions at a retail outlet near you. Founded by Paresh Rajde, they have over 60,000 outlets across the country and work with 300 service providers. We recently met the founder to map his journey so far.
First-gen entrepreneur
Paresh Rajde
Born and brought up in Kutch, Gujarat, Paresh came to Mumbai to do his CA course and has since then turned into a fan of the city. After completing his CA, Paresh practised the profession for 10 years, before the entrepreneurial bug bit him. Paresh started DhanDhanaDhan, an online lottery company which he eventually sold to Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry. Suvidhaa is Paresh’s second venture and his reason for starting is very similar to Phanindra Sama of redBus. “I thought of the concept in later part of 2006, when I was having some trouble buying railway tickets. I thought if we educated people are having so much trouble, then probably the common man faced more difficulty in getting access to such things,” says Paresh. After some research and asking around, Paresh realized there were no options existing in India which could help make things easier and less painful for people.
With this idea in mind, he first went to the railways with his proposition; and although the IRCTC site was already functional, railways didn’t see much booking coming that way. “Call it lack of awareness or unwillingness to use the platform, but most people were booking tickets still by standing in a queue at the reservation counter,” says Paresh of the scene in 2007. Suvidhaa offered Indian Railways the setting up of a backend where the IRCTC site could be effectively used to book and distribute tickets. “So that’s how the whole thing started and then when we thought, if we can offer railway tickets let’s also offer other services. Now we have created a platform where we can keep adding various services to our platform and on the other end the retailer can be the interface to help customers do various kinds of things. It is an assisted model and surely something that the Indian customers want,” says Paresh proudly.
The Suvidhaa model
Suvidhaa works with existing retailers – like a grocery store, a PCO or travel agent, who already have a brick and mortar presence. Once a retailer agrees to become a partner, he has to invest in computer hardware and internet connectivity to get going. Also they have to pay a deposit to Suvidhaa, including some amount in cash, which is the credit pipe that Suvidhaa gives to the retailer. So in a month if the retailer expects Rs 30,000 worth of transactions, he has to pay that money upfront to Suvidhaa. Then whenever a customer comes and transacts with the retailer using the Suvidhaa platform, the retailer’s balance is deducted from the amount he has deposited.

“As the retailer is handling the entire system, the customer need not be bothered about anything. They can transact just like they would have transacted with the service provider directly. They don’t have to bother with the entire technology headache, it’s easy and convenient for them,” explains Paresh. India is still largely a cash economy and therefore the opportunity that Suvidhaa is looking at is immense. While he doesn’t have any official figures to quote, Paresh pegs 92% of India’s economy to be cash dependent and transacting in cash.
The retail customer doesn’t have to pay anything to entail Suvidhaa’s services, it is the service provider who pays Suvidhaa. “It works well for the service provider, because through Suvidhaa they are able to reach a much larger number of customers without much investment on building physical infrastructure,” says Paresh. Suvidhaa mostly chooses retailers who are well located and have a large number footfalls coming into the shop. Today most Suvidhaa outlets are located in Tier 1, Top 20 cities.
And because the retailer is someone the customer is already transacting with, not much is spent on advertising or marketing the services. However some amount of local activities — focused around the area of the retailer — is done to spread awareness. Newspaper inserts and other branding collaterals are provided to the franchisees to drive engagement. Service providers also publicize their partnership with Suvidhaa, which further improves customer awareness. “When a service provider joins us, we tell them to create awareness among customers, because it is useful for them also to benefit from this alliance. The efficiencies of our system is very high, because once a customer pays us, it reaches the service provider the same day or next day, without any hardships of collecting payments that they would have to otherwise undergo,” says Paresh.
Best of all worlds
Suvidhaa has todate received $25 million in funding from Shapoor Pallonji Mistry, Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), Reliance Venture Asset Management Ltd, International Finance Corporation (World Bank Group) and Mitsui & Co – a Japanese investing major. Paresh considers this a good achievement in itself. “Getting such big names to invest in your idea and back your venture is a proof of success in itself,” he says. And on the financials side, Paresh says they have grown 100% YOY since launch.
Haresh Bhatija
Besides the funding, Paresh says the 250 member team at the startup has been an important contributor in the success. The day-to-day affairs at Suvidhaa are managed by Haresh Bhatija, who is the CEO and a board member. Haresh was the founding member of Reliance Venture Asset Management and besides Suvidhaa, serves on the board of four other ventures. A lot of learnings at Suvidhaa still comes from Paresh’s earlier online lottery/gaming business. “We have changed the product line, but the processes and methods are all still similar,” he says. Infact the information they printed in their brochure when Suvidhaa started six years back, continues to be relevant.
Talking about the innovation ideology at Suvidhaa, Haresh says innovation at Suvidhaa mostly happens on the technology front. “At Suvidhaa, we are leveraging emerging technologies like cloud to see where we can invest proportionately to reduce the cost efficiencies per transaction. Externally we are always focused on what the consumers want, what are his pain areas and how we can convert them into an opportunity,” explains Haresh.
While the venture is currently focused on expanding its reach and growing within the country, they also have plans to engage and reward end customers using the Suvidhaa platform to transact. “We have been so far focused on our first line of customers, which is the retailers. So we have a lot of incentive programs for retailers. Having said that we have a rich data of customers visiting our outlets and what they have done at outlet. We are now analyzing this data, then looking at what kind of profiling and targeting that we can do — to deliver incentives, rewards, marketing relating communications to our target audience. We will target our end consumers in the near future,” shares Haresh. Recently in partnership with Central Bank of India, Suvidhaa launched a open loop prepaid card, called the ‘Channel  Card’ – targeted at traditional retailers.
The future looks busy for Suvidhaa, as it continues to expand its service within the country. And as long as India’s romance with cash continues, Suvidhaa seems to have no reason to worry. We wish them all the best!

Title : Not good at one thing so I am trying my luck with many: Journey of ex Zopper BK Birla

Positivity keeps you driving every moment in life despite of innumerable professional and personal hiccups. Earlier, this week I met Bal Krishna Birla, who recently left ZopNow – an online grocery store founded by Birla and Mukesh Singh. Prior to Zopnow, Birla had professional stints at IT major Infosys, then he moved to Amazon and finally Asklaila where he was bitten by entrepreneurial bug. Besides commercial ventures he has been backing non profit organizations like Bhoole Bisre Geet and a few movements against suicides committed by IIT students.
While building the technology team at Asklaila, BK Birla decided to do startup and later on started a restaurant Potluck in South Bangalore. Though, Birla had to desert the restaurant business as Zopnow happened in the middle, “I wanted to focus on one startup rather than having two, hence I pulled the plug on it,” says Birla. Currently Birla has two priorities – to scale Bhoole Bisre Geet, aka BBG, a non-profit organization which has over 1 lakh music fans glued to it across the world in over 25 countries. BBG aspires to spread happiness through music and Birla says that its a fierce nonprofit organization as it doesn’t charge or pay a single penny for offline shows.
The other priority for Birla is to write a book, which primarily would be a collection of 12-18 stories around people who attempted suicide but later on turnaround and made big in business, different verticals and life.
BBG evolved from a personal inclination towards music, especially the old and forgotten Hindi songs, says Birla. “Everyone has some childhood or early memories with music, I kept listening and sharing my playlist (old Hindi song) with my friends on social media networks. Soon I realized that lots of folks are actually connecting their memories via my playlist,” adds Birla. After a year time BBG started conducting offline shows and gradually it became community that spreads happiness through music. Importantly, BBG doesn’t pay artists and performers for their representation in the shows.
Birla has also been working on making a music album called Kaash with Shammas. The album will have poems and songs written by him. The overall theme of the album will be a little bit melancholy songs set in the music of 40s and 50s. Out of curiosity I asked him how he manages time to do many things at one time? Birla flatly answers “You are bound to allocate time for things which you want to do and I do the things which I want. After Zonow I have enough leisure time on platter to focus on different things.”
During my own IIT days I have seen at least four suicides committed by students, says BK Birla. The primary reasons for such suicides were academic pressure and emotional outburst. “IIT is undoubtedly a hard nut to crack and only sharp minds reach there, however families don’t understand the competition level in IITs and hope their children to top or score maximum grades,” adds Birla. The suicide rate is increasing in IITs as well as other institution because of escalating peer pressure, lack of family support and gender gap. This always hurt me when I think of a young guy or a girl commits suicide. The situation prompted me to write a book around people who attempted suicides and later on became successful in their pursuit. My effort would be successful if anyone defers suicide after reading my book,” says Birla.
“I love starting up time and again as I feel like doing it,” says Birla. However, he finds difficulties in hiring people and building team. He urges young entrepreneurs to do inward research before doing market research for their idea, “I see this trait rare in young people they focus much on external research (appearance, too, he chuckles) but miss the internal one, adds Birla.
He also reveals that his new venture, which is at least 7-8 months away from now, would be focused on international market and again it will be in consumer Internet space. Birla cautions budding entrepreneurs to align themselves to what they are capable to do. Raising funds is not the milestone, don’t waste too much time chasing angel or VCs’ money; focus on making your product or service super awesome everything else will follow you, signs off Birla.
